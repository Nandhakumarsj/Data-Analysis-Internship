# _Task 1 - Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning_

* This just predict the score based on the sample hour from the given sample dataset
* Link for the sample data set is [here](https://github.com/Nandhakumarsj/Data-Analysis-Internship/datasets/student_scores.csv).

## Modules Used

* Scikit-Learn
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

### **Linear Regression using Scikit Learn**

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.

# _Task 6 - Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm_

* Implemented Decision Tree Model from the Scikit Learn Iris Dataset

## Modules Used

* Scikit-Learn
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
